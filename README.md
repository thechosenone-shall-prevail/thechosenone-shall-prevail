The ultimate automated penetration testing toolkit for Windows environments, focused on Active Directory attack vectors. Built by a relentless cybersecurity enthusiast who believes that **knowledge is power** and sometimes, a bit of ego is a good thing‚Äîas long as it's used for a good cause.

KERB-SLEUTH aims to be your "all-in-one" Swiss Army knife for automating enumeration, exploitation, and reporting of AD security weaknesses.

## Features

- **Automated Enumeration** - Finds and maps AD attack surfaces with minimal effort
- **One-Click Exploitation** - Launches common Active Directory attacks (Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, etc.) with ease
- **Comprehensive Reporting** - Generates actionable reports for your audits, CTFs, or just to flex on your friends
- **Modular & Extensible** - Easy to add new attack modules or customize existing ones

## Philosophy

KERB-SLEUTH is open-source because **sharing is caring** (unless it's your password). Built on the belief that learning never stops, and every imperfect attempt is a step closer to building something impactful for the community.

## Who's Behind This?

Hi, I'm just another smart person who leverages AI to the extreme, automates everything possible, and occasionally writes code that works on the first try (it happens, okay?).

**Top skills:** Python, C++, Bash, Penetration Testing, and making up new features on the fly.

**Hobbies:** Working egotistically toward a good cause, learning forever, and building tools that leave an impact.

Pull requests are welcome! If you have new attack ideas, bug fixes, or just want to help make this tool even more powerful, join the quest.

*Remember: No contribution is too imperfect‚Äîjust keep improving.*

## Fun Fact

**Extremely egotistic, but only for a good cause.**

If you're reading this, you're already part of something big. Now go break (and fix) something.
