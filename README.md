## About KERB-SLEUTH

Welcome to **KERB-SLEUTH**, the ultimate automated penetration testing toolkit for Windows environments, focused on Active Directory attack vectors. Built by a relentless cybersecurity enthusiast who believes that **knowledge is power** and sometimes, a bit of ego is a good thing—as long as it’s used for a good cause.

KERB-SLEUTH aims to be your “all-in-one” Swiss Army knife for automating enumeration, exploitation, and reporting of AD security weaknesses. If you ever thought, “I wish there was a tool that could do *everything* for AD attacks”—well, here it is. And if you didn’t think that… now you do.

## Features

- **Automated Enumeration**: Finds and maps AD attack surfaces with minimal effort.
- **One-Click Exploitation**: Launches common Active Directory attacks (Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, etc.) with ease.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates actionable reports for your audits, CTFs, or just to flex on your friends.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages AI for smarter recon and attack suggestions.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Easy to add new attack modules or customize existing ones.
- **Python, C++, GO, Bash**: Written by someone who knows the syntax (familar, not familiar, but who cares, right?).
- **For Windows**: Designed for Windows environments, because that's where the fun is.

## Philosophy

KERB-SLEUTH is open-source because **sharing is caring** (unless it's your password). Built on the belief that learning never stops, and every imperfect attempt is a step closer to building something impactful for the community.
